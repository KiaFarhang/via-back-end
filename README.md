# Distillr Back End #

This is the repository for the Typescript + Node back end for [Distillr,](https://jaketripp-distillr.herokuapp.com/) a web application built during VIA's 2018 San Antonio Codeathon.

You can view the front-end code in [the front-end repo](https://github.com/jaketripp/via) as well.

Note that this code was written under time constraints and therefore not everything will make perfect sense or be as tested as I would have liked :)
